# 🧠 Monolog

**Monolog** is a clean, AI-powered journaling web app built for people who think fast and feel smarter with clarity. It’s minimal, distraction-free, and lets users reflect, plan, or brain-dump — without noise.

## ⚡ What it does

Monolog gives you a blank space and AI support when you need it. Whether it’s for logging thoughts, sorting your day, or asking “What am I even doing?” — it’s built to adapt to YOU.

## 🚀 Features

- Clean UI built with HTML/CSS/JS
- GPT-powered journaling prompts (planned)
- Sidebar for saved entries (Notion-inspired layout)
- Light/dark theme support (coming soon)
- First full-stack deployment experience (in progress)


## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript  
- Backend: Python (Flask) or Node.js (TBD) 
- AI: OpenAI API  
- Deployment: Netlify + Render / Vercel + Railway (depending)

## 🎯 Why I built it

This is my first full-stack solo project — built from scratch to sharpen my skills in frontend, backend, API integration, and real-world deployment. It’s my sandbox for experimenting with AI, clean UI, and everything in between.

## 📦 Project Status

Monolog is in active development, designed and built as a personal learning project to explore full-stack web dev and practical AI integration.
