# Monolog

A quiet little space that turned into a soul project somewhere around day four of no sleep.

This is **Monolog** ‚Äî a journaling web app built for people who talk to themselves more than they talk to the world. Not a productivity tracker. Not a mood board. Just a place to write, feel, reflect, and maybe talk to something that listens.

Built using:
- Next.js (because pain)
- TailwindCSS (because I still believe in pretty)
- Vercel (used it for inspo, had to build the rest omo)
- Cursor (AI + VSCode = me pretending to be a 10x dev)
- Several unhealthy coping mechanisms

###  Core Features
- Journaling interface with auto-save (almost doesn‚Äôt break)
- Sidebar to browse recent entries like you‚Äôre Notion-core
- ‚ÄúWhisper to Monya‚Äù ‚Äî not a chatbot, not a therapist, just... a gentle mirror
- Sections like **Heart Guidance**, **Gratitude**, and **Present Heart** (because why not cry a little)


###  What‚Äôs Coming
- Firebase or Supabase integration to save entries (still deciding)
- AI-powered mood reflection
- Themes, light/dark/blackout-at-3am mode
- Multi-entry navigation and search
- Maybe an easter egg that sends you cat pictures when you're sad


### 
Unasked FYI: the inspo for the app name "Monolog" comes from the bengali word Mon, which means Heart. So, it's basically a safe space where you can write your heart out ( be it cursing your boss out or jutting down 3 am thoughts)

### üßæ How to Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MChakrabartyy/monolog-webapp.git
cd monolog-webapp
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
npm run dev
Then hit https://localhost:3000
And maybe write something you wouldn't say out loud.
